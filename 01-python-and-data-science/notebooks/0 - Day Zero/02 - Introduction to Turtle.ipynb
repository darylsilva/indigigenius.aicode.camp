    "Please note, we're using a special version of turtle that runs within our jupyter notebooks, so some of the tutorials online won't match up exactly with what's available to us. Specifically, we're missing a lot of functionality, but can still do the basics. If you want to get more out of your turtle, we can help you run turtle outside of these notebooks.\n",
