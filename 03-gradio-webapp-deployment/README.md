# SETUP

## Prerequisites

Before working in the module, it is important to work through the `app.ipynb` notebook using your chosen model and data to create a script called `app.py`.

This `app.py` file will be generated in the folder `02-deep-learning-computer-vision/scripts`.

## Getting Started - Learners
Unlike previous units, this unit does not require a Jupyter Notebook, or Docker container, environment. All code will be modified by students using VS Code and then submitted to a repository hosted on `HuggingFace.co`.

## Getting Started - Teachers
Lesson files and instructions will be contained in Jupyter Notebooks and can act as 'slides' for the lessons. These lessons are primarily informational.

To open the Jupyter Notebooks, open a terminal in this folder (`03-gradio-webb-app`) and run the following command:  
`jupyter notebook`

This will be similar to what was done during the first unit (`01-python-and-data-science`).
